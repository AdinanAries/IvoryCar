With my own site I can collect user emails and actively keep them coming back..
I'm  a web developer and this website will add a boost to my resume
I already had the site built before I discovered about these other options
And I also see myself doing this for long term
I also want to be able to provide my customers insights from data analysis or machine learning
My site, without violating any of the api rules, will contain additional functions beyond the provisions of the api.
like -> ads on the site.

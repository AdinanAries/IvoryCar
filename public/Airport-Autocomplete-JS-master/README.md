## First airport autocomplete package for JS üéâ

After searching extensively I found out that there is not a single official repo for Aiport searching/autocompleting.

Now there is! Check it out, use it and give me some feedback üì®

## Intro 

This package depends on [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io/) in order to search efficient the airports.json .

You can find the airports.json under the `src/data` folder. The data has being scrapped from [OpenFlights.org](https://openflights.org/data.html)

As you can see in the code in order to minimize the js size and serve it fast, the airport json is being fetched only when needed from [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/konsalex/Airport-Autocomplete-JS/master/src/data/airports.json).

This package aims to be used in travel websites, flight claiming platforms and anywhere you would love to.

## Usage üåä

1. [Initialize](#init)
2. [Custom Styling / Formatting](#custom)

<a id="init"></a>

### Initialize

In order to use it just initialize instances of airport-autocomplete objects just by passing the input's id.

```
AirportInput("id-of-the-input-1")
AirportInput("id-of-the-input-n")

<!-- or give an options JS object in order to customize regarding your needs -->

AirportInput("id-of-the-input-n", options)
```

Regarding your needs, some of you may want to give bigger attention to IATA code search, others would love the City name search to gain the attention. So in addition to that, you can define your own options settings and pass it to the airport-autocomplete object.

```
const options = {
  fuse_options : {
      shouldSort: true,
      threshold: 0.4,
      maxPatternLength: 32,
      keys: [{
          name: "IATA",
          weight: 0.25
        },
        {
          name: "name",
          weight: 0.25
        },
        {
          name: "city",
          weight: 0.5
        }
      ]
    }
};

AirportInput("id-of-the-input-1", options)
```

For additional info on how fuse_option object works you can check Fuse.js well-documented website.

### Stylying / Formatting üíÖ

You can style your Airport suggestions or even change the formatting of the output.

The **default** formatting is the following : 

`<div class="$(unique-result)" single-result" data-index="$(i)"> $(name) $(IATA) </br> $(city) ,$(country)</div>`

The formatting string parameters are listed below:

| Data        | Syntax           | Required  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Unique ID     | $(unique-result) | `True` |
| Result Index    | data-index="$(i)" | `True` |
| Airport Name     | $(name) | `False` |
| Airport IATA code     | $(IATA) | `False` |
| Airport Country     | $(country) | `False` |
| Airport City     | $(city) | `False` |

Check the index.html in the demo folder for an example with the custom formatting.

## Demo üìΩ

You can see it in action!

Clone the repo, install the dependencies and run `npm run dev` .

Then just open the `index.html` file inside demo folder and examine the code.

Here is a gif demonstrating the functionality.

2. Run the dev script.

3. Open the index.html from `demo` folder and start testing and developing.

## Languages üó£

If you are writing a web app that needs to handle inputs from other languages I have a surprise for you.

You can enrich the airports.json with the names with your own language.

Check `src/data_scripts/addLanguage.py` and how it works.

As an input you have to provide a CSV (; delimeter) with the first column the names of your language, and the second the IATA code they represent in order to match them.

This code is working but we need to make it more robust and extensible.

Any recommendations are welcome!
